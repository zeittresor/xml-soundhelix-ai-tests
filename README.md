This is a new configuration file for SoundHelix (created only by some prompts using to the ChatGPT Agent Mode by OpenAi)

First of all you need some files to make this work.. 
Make sure you have just downloaded a snapshot of the latest trunk from https://sourceforge.net/p/soundhelix/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/soundhelix/ 

Put the files of this repository in the main folder of SoundHelix and click run.bat to create a new midi song (will be saved in .\midifiles).
